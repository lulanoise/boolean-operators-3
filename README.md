# Exercise: Boolean Operators 3
Try to solve on paper the following boolean algebra operations:
* [A]: `!(!(!(false ^ false) || (true && true)))`
* [B]: considering that `x=3` and `y=2`: `!((x * y) <= 6) && (x - y != 1)`

Then compare your solutions with a Java program that tests the validity of your assumptions.
